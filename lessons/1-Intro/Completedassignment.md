# Assignment Question
In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI.

# Answer
I like Elite Dangerous, an online massive multiplayer online space opera game set in the Milky Way Galaxy. The game places you in the galaxy at a time when humanity is advanced enough that we have been able to colonize a very large portion of the galaxy. In the galaxy there are alien species as well, and they have clashes with the human population.

AI plays a role in this game in the way NPCs interact with players. It enhances the immersion that the player feels in the world of Elite Dangerous.

In the future, the game will be enhanced by artificial intelligence by enabling it expand more, both in terms of gameplay, storylines, visuals and NPC automation. In-game economy can be augmented by AI to make it realistic and highly interactive.
